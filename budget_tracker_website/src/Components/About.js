        <p className="about_p">We are a group of Computer Science students at the University of Illinois. For our CS 222 project, we decided to create an app that helps you track your spending habits.</p>
        <p className="about_p">The reason we decided upon a budget tracker app was to make financial literacy more accessible to the general public and students, too many times have we seen predatory online financial services advertising products that take advantage of the vulnerable and our group wanted to build a minimalistic buget app with no strings attached to solve this issue.</p>
